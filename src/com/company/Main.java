//Create a calculator application. Your program should ask the user which operation they would like to perform: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or square root. Depending on the userâ€™s response, your program should request that the user input either (1) or (2) numbers to perform the desired operation.
//
//Your program should perform the appropriate calculation, display the result to the user, and ask if the user would like to perform another calculation. If so, the program should restart.
